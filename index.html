            <p>I have always been fascinated with computers and what makes them work. I took my first BASIC programming course in high school and was excited to see that commands I entered could elicit a response from the big, green screen. My studies in college focused on computer mapping and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and  I graduated from the University of Louisville with a Bachelor of Science in Geography.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>My professional career has been focused on automated mapping applications and custom GIS data products. I have played with HTML and have created a few web sites using Joomla Content Management System. However, this somewhat simple approach has never given me the in-depth knowledge I desire. I also am very interested in learning how to use JavaScript on both the client and server-side.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>On the personal side, I was born and raised in Louisville, KY. I moved to Charlotte three years ago when I married my wife Kay. We are active in our church and my stepdaughter Ashley keeps us busy with her activities.
